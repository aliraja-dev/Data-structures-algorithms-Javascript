/**
 * Heaps: returns highest or lowest value in a collection in O(1) time
 * Two kinds of heaps: Max & min heap: In Max heap Parent is bigger than any of its Children and in Min heap Parent is smaller than any of its Children. A heap can have multiple number of children, however we will implement a binary heap only i.e. 2 children.
