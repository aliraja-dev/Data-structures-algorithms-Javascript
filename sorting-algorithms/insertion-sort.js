//* Insertion Sort
/**
 * Time complexity : O(n^2)
 * Space complexity : O(1)
 * Quadratic Time complexity means its not the best sorting algorithm and very expensive in terms of efficiency. IT works by searching the array sequentially and moving the unsorted items into a sorted sub-list on the left side of the array.
