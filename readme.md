# Algorithms
This project is about understanding, implementing and evaluatiing popular algorithms for common use cases in programming. We will be covering the algorithms in the following areas:

1- Searching
2- Sorting


## Implementation
The algorithms will be implemented in the Javascript language. 


## Evaluation
Algorithms will be evaluated for Time & space complexity and Big O notation will be discussed for them as well.
