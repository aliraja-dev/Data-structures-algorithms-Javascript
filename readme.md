# Data Structures & Algorithms

This project is about understanding, implementing and evaluating popular algorithms and data structures for common use cases in programming.

## Implementation Languages

This project will have implementations in Java, Python and javascript.
Switch branch to see implementations in relevant Language.
Master Branch == Javascript
Java Branch == Java
Python Branch == Python

## Algorithms

We will be covering the algorithms in the following areas:

1- Searching
2- Sorting

### List of Algorithms

#### Sorting

1- Bubble Sort
2- Merge Sort
3- Quick Sort
4- Selection Sort

#### Searching

1- Binary search
2- linear search

And we will also be discussing the Big O Notations for the time and space complexity in best, average and the worst case scenarios as well for these algorithms.

## Data Structures

1- Arrays
2- Linked Lists (singly & doubly)
3- Maps
4- Sets
5- Queues
6- Priority Queues
7- Stacks
8- Trie
9- Hash tables
10- heaps (max and min)
11- binary search tree
12- graphs

## Implementation

The algorithms will be implemented in the Javascript language. In case, where ES6 provides built in data structures for sets and maps, we will show both built in and a custom implementation of it.

## Evaluation

Important part of knowing algorithms is to know their runtimes and which algorithm is best suited for a given problem and its underlying data structure to be used as well. Thus Algorithms will be evaluated for Time & space complexity and Big O notation will be discussed for them.
